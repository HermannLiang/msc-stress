function Out_MCSE = cl_MCSE(x,m,r,tau,Scale)
%
%  This function calculates the multiscale fuzzy entropy (MFE) whose coarse-graining uses mean (MFE_mu)
%
%
% Inputs:
%
% x: univariate signal - a vector of size 1 x N (the number of sample points)
% m: embedding dimension
% r: threshold (it is usually equal to 0.15 of the standard deviation of a signal - because we normalize signals to have a standard deviation of 1, here, r is usually equal to 0.15)
% n: fuzzy power (it is usually equal to 2)
% tau: time lag (it is usually equal to 1)
% Scale: the number of scale factors
%
%
% Outputs:
%
% Out_MFE: a vector showing the MFE_mu of x
