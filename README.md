# My master research project: quantifying cognitive stress pattern through time, frequency and nonlinear analysis
ECG signals recorded via Arduino are in the text files. Heart rate variablity (HRV) is extracted after R-peak detection.
47 features extracted from HRV
Stress state classification using SVM, feedforward NN and LSTM network
